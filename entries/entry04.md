# Week 4: Learning how to Work Xcode!

## The things I learned
#### What the Appdelegate.swift does 
    
* This file gives the app you are creating a place to run.  

#### What the ViewControll.Swift does
   
* It is where you will code the buttons and inputs that will be functional in 
     your app

#### What the StoryBoard does
    
* This is where the developer will add all their buttons for the app that they are making.
* The viewcontrol and the storyboard will connect to make the buttons functional.
