### Things I did on Monday 
- Started to make a google drawing of the app idea and the layout I want it to have 

### Things I did on Tuesday  
- make the opening page to my app 
- launched it in the simulator and it didn't work
- spent a period debugging 
- added to my drawing 

### Things I will do this week 
- Connected the front end to the back end 
- Make a drawing of the apps layout 
- Figure out the way to make the layout 

### The goal of this week 
The goal of this week is to have a MVP so that I
can have it for the showcase. The point of my app that I would like to havr done 
is that the user can input the item they spent money, the price, and their weekly budget
and then it will return the remaining budget. 


## THE REAL STRUGGLE OF THIS WEEK

I  didn't end up finishing my MVP.

I faced many struggles. I Was planning a lot this week and as I began to work on it 
I realized that I was not going to be able to get it all done. The reason that I wasn't going to be able to get the 
MVP done is because I had a lot more parts that I had to learn how to do until I was able to make a fully functioning app.

This is what My App looks like so far:

The reason you are seeing it on my storyboard insted of in the simulation is because when I run it, nothing appears.


# TAKAWAYS
I expected everything to go smoothly, I finished my Tutorial and I was watching videos. But It did not I 
got really discouraged. Then I remebered to always keep trying things, And they aren't going to  work on the first try 
You learn from faliure .
