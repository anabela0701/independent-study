# Week Three: Learning Swift!

Swift is a easy language to learn in the part of actually coding 
but the part that I am strugging with is learing how to navigate 
around Xcode. Xcode is the app that I am using to code along, on my laptop, with 
the lessons that I am following and where I am ultimatly going to code
the app. I am still tinkering with what I am learning. 

How I am learning swift is by watching and reading the lessons provided by 
A website called Udacity! I am following the Swift for Beginners lessons. 
There are a total of 4 different lessons : Variables and types, Strings, If statements, and Functions.



## Lesson 1: Variable!
The first lesson that Udacity has you go through, is how to define and minuplate variables. There are many ways to manipulate and set variables. The photo below shows the way you set variables and the way to put a variable inside a string. 
!["YAY!"](../photos/vars.png)

In swift there are two different types of variables, lets and vars. when you define a variable as a let you can not change it in any further code. While with a plain old var you can redefine it in later code if you wanted to change the value 

Ways you can minpulate a string:
* .reverse method, this method allows for you to return the string or variable backwards 
* .count method this gives you the number of chacters 
* .unicodeScalars this allows you to add emojis to your apps text. 


## Lesson 2: If statements
They are pretty much exactly what they sound like if a condidtion is true it will run the code you specify. 

'''func goEat() {
    print("nom")
}
func goToSleep(){
    print("zzzzz")
}
var hungry = false

if hungry{
    goEat()
}
else {
    goToSleep()
}
'''

## Takaways 
Keep trying things! Always tinker because as Mr.Mueller says “You learn best by doing” and its true! I have been watching videos and things but I thought I understood everthing just by reading and watching but in reality i learned more about the things that I tried myself!
