# Week Two: New Topic!!

Hey again!! If you read my last blog entry, I was pretty set on my topic of flutter but that changed 
I have changed my topic to Swift. The reason for the change in topics is because as I was looking at the 
tutorial for flutter and I was looking into learning enough to make an app and I felt that 9 Weeks was not enough time 
for me to learn flutter. So I began to look into Swift and Java during that research I felt that Swift was a better fit for me due to the fact 
that it will be compatible with my phone. Also becuase Swift has better tutorials for me to follow and I feel I can learn enough to make an app in the 9 weeks of time we are given. 


## App Ideas
 
* A app that has the wait time of the security lines in airports
* A app that allows users to input long term goals and then the app will give little gentle reminders about the goals that the person has set.
* A app dedicated to in coming college freshamn group chats. Universities and Colleges can make group chats and you have to have the code to join.
* A app that allows the person to mark off where he or she has been and they can keep track of all the place they have been. Maybe be able to share to other social medias. 

## Issues I see arising With Each App 

* The security line app and the Goal app requries me to learn Swift and Firebase. I don't see myself having enough time to learn 2 new languages
* The college grouop chat app requires to partner with colleges. I may be able to make a locked group chat app, but that has alreasdu been created. 
* The traveling app seems like the most plausible because I can have it not save at first. Then later learn a language like firebase to have the user make a account and their travels can be saved then. 

## Next Steps

These next 2-3 weeks are going to be intesive learning of swift because I would like to if not the week after next week to start my app. 

## Takaways
* The one thing that I took away from this week of Independent study is that original plans do not always work out. 
This is an important lesson is because I realized this last week but I wanted to learn Flutter so bad, but it was not feasible for me to do tha
so I decied to transfer to Swift.
