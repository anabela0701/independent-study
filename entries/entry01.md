#  Week One: Exploration!

This week was alot of exploration for me. I went from being set on doing A-Frame
to wanting to do Flutter. I have ultimtaly decied on doing flutter, the reason that I have 
decied to do Flutter is because I would like to make an app that I can upload to both Android and 
IOS. 

## The Process:
The process I went through to deciding on the topic of flutter was an interesting one. At first I was SET on doing Swift, because I wanted to make apps for my phone. Then I thought about it and I realized that I didnt want to make an app. So I looked into A-Frame because I thought it would be cool to make a VR game and it would be cool to Demo at the expo. Then when I was researching about A-Frame, I realized that I was a deeper dive that I would have to take to be able to make a really cool VR game. 
Then I stumbled upon Flutter, which is like swift but you can upload your apps to both IOS and Android! I began thinking of apps that people could use and I figured out a few app ideas!

## Takaways
<ul>
    <li>Deciding is hard, but I realized that I needed to figure out how to make the app that I wanted to make, and what languages i need for it.</li>
    <li>Do a lot of researching! If you don't know enough about the code and how it works then its just gonna be harder in thd end to learn!</li>
</ul>
